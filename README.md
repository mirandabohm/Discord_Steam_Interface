# Discord_Steam_Interface

This project finds a Discord user's current activity and presents their status on this platform accordingly. 

This is to include either the name of the active window running, or the name of the game currently being played on Steam. 

This program or game name will be displayed by a bot which can be incorporated into a player's active server. 

Additionally, if player is registered on Steam, their activity status will be translated as follows: 

   STEAM STATUS        | STEAM STATE | DISCORD STATUS
   'Offline'           |      0      | 'Offline'
   'Online'            |      1      | 'Online'
   'Busy'              |      2      | 'dnd'
   'Away'              |      3      | 'Idle'
   'Snooze'            |      4      | 'Idle'
   'Looking to trade'  |      5      | 'Online'
   'Looking to play'   |      6      | 'Online'
